# Web Reference

This library defines a data model that expresses a reference to a subset 
of the [Html 5](https://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-LC/) document specifications, 
including:

* Tags
  * Attributes
  * Events
* Attributes
  * Tags it applies to
* Events
  * Fields
  * Details, _i_._e_. cancelable, bubbles, etc.
* Lookup by Category
  * Tags
  * Attributes
  * Events

The data model is generated by the `web-reference-factory` crate. 

The initial implementation of this factory does not use 
[Reffy](https://github.com/w3c/reffy), but imo would be the better
choice for correctness and completeness, since it extracts its 
information from the source specifications.

> Unnecessary to the original requirements the following are missing 
> specifications; CSS, SVG, ARIA, etc. 
> 
> However, these can be included in the future. 
> 
> Once the `reffy` based factory is implemented `PRs` will be welcome too.

## Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
web-reference = { version = "0.1", features = ['deserialize'] }
```

## Example

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::BufReader;

use web_reference::prelude::*;

// retrieve json from file
let json_file   = File::open("html-5-specs.json")?;
let json_reader = BufReader::new(json_file);

// deserialize reference from json
let reference = serde_json::from_reader(json_reader)?;

// use reference
let div_tag         = reference.get_tag("div").expect("expect div to be defined");
let _div_attributes = reference.get_tag_attributes(div_tag);

.
.
.
```

## Features

* `serialize` - using [`Serde`]()
* `deserialize` - using [`Serde`]()
* `ordered-map` - useful when combined with the `serialize` option for deterministic output

## Road Map

- [ ] Complete(r) Reference of HTML 5 specifications using [Reffy](https://github.com/w3c/reffy) 
for complete/correct-ness

- [ ] Database version, to reduce memory footprint at expense of performance

- [ ] CLI, human interface to query HTML 5 specifications
